# Alembic setup

[Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) is an easy way to migrate a database between different schematas without having to write (all)
migration scripts by hand.

When using this, make sure to adapt the [alembic.ini](../alembic.ini) file and add a connection URL that actually matches your database
specifications.
